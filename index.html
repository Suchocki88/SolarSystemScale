                <h3>Activity Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Solar System Scale Detectives</strong> engages students in creating an accurate physical scale model of the solar system using mathematical proportional reasoning. Teams calculate planetary distances when the Sun is scaled to 1 meter diameter, then measure and place planets at correct scaled positions. Students discover the shocking reality of how much empty space exists in our solar system while developing systematic measurement skills and connecting their findings to space exploration challenges.</p>
